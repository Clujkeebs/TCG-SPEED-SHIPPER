Wrote the plan (`PLAN.md`), shared data model (`DATA-MODEL.md`, `suite/shared/models.js`, 10 tests
passing), the working agreement and kickoff prompts. Sessions `scan` (branch `suite/scan`) and
`extension` (branch `suite/extension`) are started. The `agent` session is held: the owner's weekly
Claude limit was already in warning, and the Agent needs the other two to exist first.
Open facts to re-check, from `PLAN.md` section 2: TCGplayer's CSV import columns, whether any
automation is allowed, each card-data provider's terms.
Needs Builder: none
Needs owner: say "go suite" on the board after reading the one-page summary; read TCGplayer's
rules with Claude (board task S2); pick two or three sellers to test.
Next: review the first PRs from `scan` and `extension`; start `agent` when there is room.
